## üìä CSV Format

The application supports two CSV formats:

### Standard Format
| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| MessageID | Yes | Unique identifier for each message |
| CandidateID | Yes | Identifier to group messages by candidate |
| Entity | Yes | "AI", "user", or variations |
| Message | Yes | The message content |
| Date | Yes | Format: "d/m/yyyy h:mm am/pm" or "d/m/yyyy h:mmam/pm" |
| FullName | No | Candidate's full name |

### Summary Format
| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| candidateId | Yes | Unique candidate identifier |
| candidateName | Yes | Candidate's full name |
| messageCount | Yes | Total messages in conversation |
| startTime | Yes | ISO date string |
| duration | Yes | Duration in milliseconds |
| messages | Yes | Pipe-separated messages |
| decision | Yes | PASS/FAIL/NO_RESP |
| tags | Yes | Comma-separated tags |

## üéØ Conversation Funnel Analysis

The dashboard now includes a sophisticated conversation funnel that tracks candidate progression through:

1. **Stage 1: AI Engagement** - Initial greeting and introduction
2. **Stage 2: Interview Questions** - Main interview with sub-stages:
   - 2.1: First question answered
   - 2.2: Second question answered
   - (Dynamically numbered based on actual questions)
3. **Stage 3: HR Interview Scheduling** - Date/time confirmation
4. **Stage 4: Decision** - AI makes hiring decision

### Key Metrics:
- **Time to Decision**: Measures from conversation start to AI decision (not last message)
- **Conversion Rates**: Shows percentage progressing through each stage
- **Drop-off Points**: Identifies where candidates exit the process
- **Average Time per Stage**: Helps optimize interview flow

## üîê Security

- API keys are validated in real-time
- Keys are never exposed in the frontend
- All API calls include error handling
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse

## üìà Performance

- Efficient data processing with progress indicators
- Caching for API validation results
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- Lazy loading for large datasets
