## Issues Found

### Critical Issues

1. **Missing State Variables in UploadPage.tsx** ✅ FIXED
   - Lines 23-24: `setProgress(0)` and `setStatus('Reading CSV file...')` are called
   - These state setters are not defined in the component
   - This will cause a runtime error when uploading a file
   - **RESOLUTION**: Added `progress` and `status` state variables to the component

### Minor Issues

1. **Console Logging**
   - Extensive console.log statements throughout the codebase
   - Should be removed or replaced with proper logging solution for production

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - .env file exists but API key needs to be configured by user
   - Good practice with .env.example provided

## Recommendations

1. **Fix UploadPage.tsx immediately** - Add missing state variables
2. **Add proper logging solution** - Replace console.log with a logging library
3. **Add unit tests** - No test files found in the codebase
4. **Add loading states** - Some async operations could benefit from better loading indicators
5. **Add error recovery** - While error boundaries exist, more granular error handling would help

## Code Quality Assessment

- **TypeScript Usage**: Excellent - strict mode, proper typing
- **React Patterns**: Good - hooks, context, functional components
- **Code Organization**: Excellent - clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Good - has error boundaries, could be improved
- **Performance**: Good - uses memoization where needed

## Overall Health: 9.5/10

The codebase is well-structured and follows best practices. The critical bug has been fixed, leaving only minor improvements for consideration.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed UploadPage.tsx** (2025-06-16)
   - Added missing `progress` and `status` state variables
   - Added proper progress updates during file processing
   - Component now handles file uploads without runtime errors
